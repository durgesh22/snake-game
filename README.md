## Project Title

**Snake-Game**
*A classic snake game implementation*

---

## Overview

Provide a succinct summary of what the project is:

> A simple/or enriched implementation of the classic Snake arcade game. The player controls a snake (or similar entity) which moves around a grid or canvas, consumes “food” items to grow, and must avoid colliding with walls or itself. This project demonstrates programming fundamentals, game-loop design, user input, rendering, collision detection, and (optionally) scoring and reinvention of the original concept.

---

## Features

List the main features of this particular implementation. For example:

* Real-time movement of the snake across a game field
* Growth of the snake upon eating food items
* Random spawning of food items
* Collision detection: with walls, self, maybe obstacles
* Score tracking / high score logic
* Adjustable difficulty (speed increases, grid size changes)
* Clean modular code structure (classes/functions)
* (Optional) Sound effects / graphical enhancements / UI elements

You may tailor this to your repository’s specifics.

## Technology Stack

Describe the languages, libraries, frameworks, tools used. For example:

* Language: Python / Java / JavaScript / C++ (whichever fits)
* Library or engine: e.g., Pygame for Python, HTML5 Canvas + JS, etc
* Build tools, dependencies
* Platform: desktop, web, mobile

## Project Structure

Explain the main files and folder organization. Example:

```
/snake-game
│  README.md
│  main.py                ← entry point
│  game_logic.py          ← module for snake movement, collisions
│  rendering.py           ← module for drawing the game
│  assets/
│    images/
│    sounds/
│  config.py              ← configurable parameters (grid size, speed)
│  …
```

Add a short description of each major file/module.

## Installation & Setup

Detail steps for someone to get the project running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/durgesh22/snake-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any): e.g.,

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   or (for web) open `index.html` in a browser.
5. (Optional) Configure settings: edit `config.py` to adjust grid size, speed, colors, etc.

## How to Play

Explain user controls and rules:

* Use arrow keys / WASD to move the snake up/down/left/right
* The snake continuously moves; direction changes via input
* Eat the food icon/item to grow longer and increase score
* Avoid collisions:

  * Hitting walls ends the game
  * Running into the snake’s own body ends the game
* The objective: achieve the highest possible score/growth.
* (Optional) Additional modes: timed mode, obstacles, increased speed.

## Code Highlights

Call out interesting or noteworthy parts of the implementation:

* The game loop handles input → update → render
* Snake represented as e.g., a list/array of coordinate pairs; growth handled by adding a new head and removing tail unless food is eaten
* Food positioning uses random generation avoiding the snake’s body
* Collision detection implemented by checking the new head position against bounds and body array
* Score system increments on eating food; speed or difficulty may ramp up
* Modular design: separation of concerns (input, logic, rendering)
* Configurable parameters (grid size, cell size, initial speed) make customization easier

## Possible Improvements & Future Work

Highlight features you might add later or encourage collaborators to add:

* Add sound effects and background music
* Add a high‐score leaderboard (local or online)
* Add multiple game modes (e.g., obstacles, wrap-around edges, multiplayer)
* Improve graphics or use a game engine for richer visuals
* Mobile/touch controls support
* Better UI (start screen, pause/resume, game over screen)
* Code refactoring: e.g., use OOP (if not already), unit tests
* Performance optimizations for larger grid sizes
